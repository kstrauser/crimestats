1 The 2013 population figures are FBI estimates based on provisional data from the U.S. Census Bureau.  (See Data Declaration.) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 The FBI does not publish arson data unless it receives data from either the agency or the state for all 6 months for 2012 and/or 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 Birmingham and Mobile, Alabama, submitted a 12 month total for 2012 offenses; therefore, no 2012 six month figures were included in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 The population for the city of Mobile, Alabama, includes 55,819 inhabitants from the jurisdiction of the Mobile County Sheriff's Department.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 The figure shown for the 2013 rape offense was reported using the new definition of rape and is not comparable to previous years' historical forcible rape data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6 Because of changes in the state/local agency's reporting practices, figures are not comparable to previous years' data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7 The FBI determined that the agency's data were overreported.  Consequently, those data are not included in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8 The FBI determined that the agency did not follow national Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program guidelines for reporting the 2012 larceny-theft offense.  Consequently, this figure is not included in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9 The data collection methodology for the offense of forcible rape does not comply with national UCR Program guidelines.  Consequently, their figures for forcible rape and violent crime (of which forcible rape is a part) are not included in this Report. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE:  All the 2012 rape figures were reported based on the historical definition of forcible rape.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
